     *This program is designed to compute the sum of all numbers between 24 and 144 (inclusive) and these numbers have to be multiples of 8. The program starts using a for

     *is, then the number is added to the sum. When all the multiples have been added up, the print statement tells the user the sum of all the numbers between 24 and 144
     *of which the numbers are multiples of 8.
